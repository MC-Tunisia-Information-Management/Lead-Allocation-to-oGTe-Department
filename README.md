# Lead-Allocation-to-oGTe-Department
The function `copyLeadsToOGTe` is designed to transfer leads from one Google Sheets spreadsheet to another based on specific criteria. It begins by accessing the active spreadsheet and relevant sheets, retrieving data from a specified range in the source sheet. It then iterates through each row of data to identify leads marked as "oGTe". For each qualifying lead, it checks if it already exists in the destination sheet to avoid duplication. If not found, it appends the lead's information (name, email, phone, faculty, field of study, and level of study) to the destination sheet. The function also logs the status of each operation for tracking purposes. The auxiliary function `findFirstEmptyRow` helps locate the first empty row in the destination sheet where new data can be added.
